                The W3Schools website is a great example of Hick's Law. "Hick's Law means that the more choices you offer to your users, the longer it will take them to pick one. In a web design context, long choice times tend to mean higher bounce, lower engagement and more user frustration. That's why, in general, less is always more."

            <p>
                On family Search website we can see the web design principle of repetition. This principle is manifested in this website in every different section/ topic of the page as we cannotice that first comes the big font size phrases, then the smaller text and then a butoon to redirect the user to that specific topic or section.

            <h3>Contrast</h3>
            <a href="https://www.byui.edu/">Brigham Young University - Idaho</a>

            <p>
                Brigham Young University - Idaho is a wonderful example of the principle of contrast. Contrast, in web design means to highlight important details in the website in order to get the attention of the user. It could be through size, color, or content. In this specific website we can see that the first image is much larger than all of the other ones and that the words on the image have different font sizes to contrast and get the user's attention and to highlight the main message and first impression that they want the user to get from the website.
