            <h2>Where is Aargau located?</h2>
            <p>Aargau is one of the most northerly cantons of Switzerland. 
                It is situated by the lower course of the Aare River, which is why 
                the canton is called Aar-gau (meaning "Aare province"). It is one of
                 the most densely populated regions of Switzerland.</p>

        <section class="origin">
            <h2>Aargau: origins</h2>
            <p>The area of Aargau and the surrounding areas were controlled by the 
                Helvetians, a member of the Celts, as far back as 200 BC. It was 
                eventually occupied by the Romans and then by the 6th century, the 
                Franks. The Romans built a major settlement called Vindonissa, 
                near the present location of Brugg. Later on, When Frederick IV of 
                Habsburg sided with Antipope John XXIII at the Council of Constance, 
                Emperor Sigismund placed him under the Imperial ban. In July 1414, 
                the Pope visited Bern and received assurances from them, that they 
                would move against the Habsburgs. A few months later the Swiss 
                Confederation denounced the Treaty of 1412. Shortly thereafter in 
                1415, Bern and the rest of the Swiss Confederation used the ban as a 
                pretext to invade the Aargau. The Confederation was able to quickly 
                conquer the towns of Aarau, Lenzburg, Brugg and Zofingen along with 
                most of the Habsburg castles.
